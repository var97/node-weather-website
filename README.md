# node-weather-website
It is weather showing website created using NodeJS

I have used mapbox api for geocoding and darksky.net api for fetching weather information using latitude and longitude provided by mapbox api.

Various node modules have been used in this project like Express, handlebars, request, etc. 

You can install required node modules by using this command : npm install
